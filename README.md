## Background
Positive Pathways was an open innovation challenge to develop a tech-centered solution that supports Indigenous youth who are struggling with mental health issues. As a solution, I proposed a social media app that aims to foster deeper connections amongst Indigenous and non-Indigenous youths through by sharing stories!

The three main features of the app are: **a social media feed, bounty/cosmetics screen, and lastly the user's story collection screen**.

## The Solution and The Ecosystem
By no means did I reinvent the wheel. Afterall, from an expert's glance, this may even seem like the typical cookiecutter app developed by a similar naive student like myself. However, what I'd like to highlight in this app is the novelty of how the features of this app collaborate with each to create what I'd dubbed the exponential growth.

As an ex-crisis line volunteer, I found that sharing stories whether it be by telling them or even writing them down, it helps the authors to organize their thoughts and feelings. And often times, this simple act was enough to regain stability in one's situation. So this app aims to foster that habit of journaling and encourage the development of journaling habits by addressing writer's block and providing users' goals of cosmetics they can purchase in-app. Should a user hit writer's block, there is a button they can click which will generate three suggestions on how they could continue their current story (OpenAI). 

<div style="text-align: center;">

And to somewhat guide the users in the stories they write, there would be certains prompts (which I call bounties) in the app store. If the user writes stories which matches any of these prompts (evaluated roughly by OpenAI chatbots) they would be awarded in app currency. This in-app currency can then be spent to generate more suggestions in the next story they write. So, more stories they write, the more in-app currency they earn, and the more suggestions they can buy; expoential growth. To also create a community sense, users can also choose to share their stories in public forums!
