## Background
Positive Pathways was an open innovation challenge to develop a tech-centered solution that supports Indigenous youth who are struggling with mental health issues. As a solution, I proposed a social media app that aims to foster deeper connections amongst Indigenous and non-Indigenous youths by sharing stories!

The three main features of the app are: **the bounty/comestic store screen, a social media feed, and the user's story collection screen**.

## The Solution and The Ecosystem
By no means did I reinvent the wheel. Afterall, from an expert's glance, this may even seem like the typical cookiecutter app developed by a similar naive student like myself. However, what I'd like to highlight in this app is the novelty of how the features of this app collaborate with each other to create what I'd dubbed the *exponential growth*.

As an ex-crisis line volunteer, I found that sharing stories whether it be by telling them or even writing them down, it helped the authors to organize their thoughts and feelings. Often times, this simple act was enough to regain stability in one's situation. So this app aims to foster the habit of journaling and encourage it by addressing writer's block. Should a user hit writer's block, there is a button they can click to generate three suggestions on how they could continue their current story (OpenAI).

To somewhat guide the stories users write, I also incorporated prompts (which I call bounties) in the app store. If the user writes stories which matches any of those prompts (evaluated roughly by OpenAI chatbots) they would be awarded in-app currency. This in-app currency can then be spent to generate more suggestions in the next story they write or be used to purchase comestics in the app store. The more stories users write, the more in-app currency they would earn. When they have more currency, they could buy more suggestions, and with more suggestions the more stories they can write; *exponential growth*. To also create a community sense, users can also choose to share their stories in public forums!
