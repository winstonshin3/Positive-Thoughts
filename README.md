## Background
Positive Pathways was an open innovation challenge to develop a tech-centered solution that supports Indigenous youth who are struggling with mental health issues. For our solution, we propose a social media app that aims to foster deeper connections amongst Indigenous and non-Indigenous youths through the educating, understanding, and sharing of stories!
